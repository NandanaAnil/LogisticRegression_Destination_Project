Destination Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression for predicting travel destinations based on user-specific features. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training using scikit-learn, performance evaluation with classification metrics, and visualization of results. This notebook serves as a foundational machine learning project focused on binary/multiclass classification tasks in Python.

Key Features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis with visualizations

Logistic regression model implementation

Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)

Scikit-learn and matplotlib-based workflow
